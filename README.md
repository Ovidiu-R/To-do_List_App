The purpose of this project is to create a simple To-Do App that allows users to add, modify and delete tasks as well as organising said tasks into projects. Each task is to have a title, description, deadline and priority, which will be represented in the UI through color coding. On the left side of the screen, a menu will allow the user to switch between viewing daily and weekly tasks, tasks belonging to a specific project or everything at once, in the order of their deadline. Throughout this project, my focus will be on respecting OOP principles and most importantly the Single Responsability Principle in order to create clean and easily extendable code.
