The purpose of this project is to create a simple To-Do App that allows users to add, modify and delete tasks as well as organising said tasks into projects. Each task is to have a title, description, deadline and priority value, which will be represented in the UI through color coding. A nav menu will allow the user to switch between viewing all tasks to viewing only those tasks whose deadline matches the current date (daily and weekly) as well as viewing only tasks belonging to a particular project. The projects themselves can likewise be created and deleted.
In order to retain user information in between page loads, the app makes use of local storage.

Throughout this project, my main focus has been on respecting OOP principles and most importantly the Single Responsability Principle in order to create clean and easily extendable code.
